# Upliance.ai Data Analysis Internship Assignment

## About the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends for upliance.ai, an AI-powered cooking assistant. This analysis aims to understand the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders, identify popular dishes, and explore demographic factors that influence user behavior. Additionally, visualizations are created to showcase key insights.

## Project Overview
The project involves analyzing three datasets:
- **UserDetails.csv**: Contains information about users such as their age, location, registration date, and favorite meals.
- **CookingSessions.csv**: Tracks cooking sessions, including session ID, start and end times, meal types, and session ratings.
- **OrderDetails.csv**: Contains data about orders placed by users, including order date, dish names, meal types, and amounts.

The analysis involves:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency across datasets.
2. **Data Merging**: Combining the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Identifying popular dishes, understanding session behavior, and analyzing the impact of demographics on cooking habits.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating charts to highlight key findings.
5. **Business Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights for upliance.ai based on the data analysis.

## Key Insights and Findings
- **Popular Dishes**: We identified the top 10 most popular dishes based on user orders.
- **Session vs Order Trends**: We explored how the number of cooking sessions relates to the number of orders placed by users.
- **Demographic Influence**: Analysis of user demographics (age, location) and how they impact their cooking and ordering habits.

## Business Recommendations
- Based on the analysis, we recommend focusing on promoting the most popular dishes and exploring specific demographic groups (e.g., age range, location) that exhibit high order volume to optimize product offerings and marketing strategies.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
